# Interfacing-Fingerprint-Sensor-with-Raspberry-Pi  
PYTHON MINI PROJECT  

INTRODUCTION  
- Accuracy and reliability are the two most important parameters when it comes to biometric applications and that too with advanced embedded computers. Fingerprint verification is one of the oldest known biometric techniques known but still is the most widely used because of its simplicity and good levels of accuracy. It’s a well-known fact that every human being is born with a different pattern on the fingers and this feature is exploited to identify and differentiate between two different persons that is what the factor which helped to initiate the model.

OBJECTIVE  
- This project aims at developing a modular biometric security authentication and monitoring system which utilizes a biodynamic physiological profile, unique for each individual and advancements of the state of the art in behavioral and other biometrics.

CONCLUSION  
- Fingerprint recognition is one of the most popular and accurate Biometric technologies.However, recognizing fingerprints in Linux based embedded computers (raspberry pi) is still a very complex problem. This entire work is done on the Linux based embedded computer called raspberry pi, fingerprint reader access, authentication and recognition using python were entirely done on raspberry pi. This project provides a standardized fingerprint model which is used to synthesize the template of fingerprints. The final fingerprint can be used to match with others in fingerprints present in the database to show the capability of this model.
