# Interfacing-Fingerprint-Sensor-with-Raspberry-Pi
Python Project
#Objective
This project aims at developing a modular biometric security authentication and monitoring system which utilizes a biodynamic physiological profile, unique for each individual and advancements of the state of the art in behavioral and other biometrics.

#Methodology
In this Raspberry Pi Finger Print sensor interfacing project, we have used a 4 push buttons: one for enrolling the new finger print, one for deleting the already fed finger prints and rest two for increment/decrement the position of already fed Finger prints. A LED is used for indication that fingerprint sensor is ready to take finger for matching. Here we have used a fingerprint module which works on UART. So here we have interfaced this fingerprint module with Raspberry Pi using a USB to Serial converter.
