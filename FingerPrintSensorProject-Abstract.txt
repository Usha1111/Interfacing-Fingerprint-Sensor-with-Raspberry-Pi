Biometric authentication is one of the most popular and accurate technology. Nowadays, it is used in many real time applications. However, recognizing fingerprints in Linux based embedded computers (raspberry pi) is still a very complex problem. This entire work is done on the Linux based embedded computer called raspberry pi, in which database creation and management, web page creation using PHP language, fingerprint reader access, authentication and recognition using python were entirely done on raspberry pi. 
This discusses on the standardized authentication model which is capable of extracting the fingerprints of individual and store that in database. Then we will use the fingerprints to match with the fingerprints present in the database to show the capability of this model.
